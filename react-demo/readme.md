# React learning / demo

This little project is what I used to learn the basics of React, and fiddle with it, Redux, and a host of other things.    
For example, without this little toy this explorer you're using wouldn't exist.

To describe it briefly, it is a simple comments app. You can add a comment, remove all comments, retrieve comments from an online source (it's gh-pages so no interaction on serverside ... just a JSON to simulate it).    
Hope you find it entertaining and useful if you want to learn something (source code at [the github repo](http://github.com/sabinmarcu/react-learning)).
