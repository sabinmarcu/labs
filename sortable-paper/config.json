The catch is – it acts as Material Paper is supposed to (almost).\n When detaching from the list, the item gets bumped up. While moving, the movement is fluid and the sorting likewise, with keeping a nice shadow and grouping with grouped items (to the left and right of the selected item), making a nice same-level paper.  In the demo I’ve added a small border to make the views more apparent, even though it is not necessary for production. It’s entirely up to the person to decide what to put inside a window (pane / paper).\n\nDemo: \n\n```js\n    import Window from “window”;\n    import WindowGroup from “window”;\n\n    import YourComponent from “wherever”;\n\n    <WindowGroup>\n        {Array.apply(null, Array(4)).map((it, index) => {\n                return <Window index={index} width={index === 2 && 400 || 200}><YourComponent /></Window>\n            }\n        )}\n    </WindowGroup>\n```"},"previews":{"chrome":"preview.png","":"preview.png"}}
