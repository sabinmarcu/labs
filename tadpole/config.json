First came Arrow Brainstorming, with innovative UI and syncing between clients, but had major preformace issues, and was to be my last application without using some frontend framework. To be honest, I'm quite happy of how it all turned out, since the last ever commit was in June 2013\n\nTadpole was the second iteration, rebuilt from the ground up with an awesome build system (at the time it was amazing), great bundling, a superb UI built with AngularJS, ad-hoc client syncing and collaboration, exports, imports, and much more. \n\nFor now, both projects are discontinued (you can find both on my [Github Page](https://github.com/sabinmarcu)) ([Tadpole](https://github.com/sabinmarcu/tadpole) and [Arrow](https://github.com/sabinmarcu/arrow)).\n"}}
